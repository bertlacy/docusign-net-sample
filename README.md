# docusign-net-sample

Sample DocuSign .NET project based on this [code walkthrough](http://iodocs.docusign.com/APIWalkthrough/requestSignatureFromDocument).

The code from the original walkthrough has been modified:
- Anchor Text used for positioning of DocuSign tabs 
- JSON Request Format
- PONOs to construct DocuSign request body

In order to use this sample code, signup for a free DocuSign Developer account [here](https://secure.docusign.com/signup/developer) and add your credentials to the RequestSignatureOnDocument.cs class.
